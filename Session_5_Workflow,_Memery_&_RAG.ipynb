All agents share the following attributes and methods: name : The unique name of the agent. description : The description of the agent in text. run : The method that runs the agent given a task as a string or a list of messages, and returns a TaskResult . Agents are expected to be stateful and this method is expected to be called with new messages, not complete history . run_stream : Same as run() but returns an iterator of messages that subclass BaseAgentEvent or BaseChatMessage followed by a TaskResult as the last item. See autogen_agentchat.messages for more information on AgentChat message types. Assistant Agent # AssistantAgent is a built-in agent that uses a language model and has the ability to use tools. Warning AssistantAgent is a “kitchen sink” agent for prototyping and educational purpose – it is very general. Make sure you read the documentation and implementation to understand the design choices. Once you fully understand the design, you may want to implement your own agent.

A team is a group of agents that work together to achieve a common goal. We’ll first show you how to create and run a team. We’ll then explain how to observe the team’s behavior, which is crucial for debugging and understanding the team’s performance, and common operations to control the team’s behavior. AgentChat supports several team presets: RoundRobinGroupChat : A team that runs a group chat with participants taking turns in a round-robin fashion (covered on this page). Tutorial SelectorGroupChat : A team that selects the next speaker using a ChatCompletion model after each message. Tutorial MagenticOneGroupChat : A generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. Tutorial Swarm : A team that uses HandoffMessage to signal transitions between agents. Tutorial Note When should you use a team? Teams are for complex tasks that require collaboration and diverse expertise. However, they also demand more scaffolding to steer compared to single agents. While AutoGen simplifies the process of working with teams, start with a single agent for simpler tasks, and transition to a multi-agent team when a single agent proves inadequate. Ensure that you have optimized your single agent with the appropriate tools and instructions before moving to a team-based approach.

These transformations present substantial challenges to ecosystems, economies, and communities globally.

            "\n",
            "1. **Human Influence**: The majority of climate scientists agree that human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, are the primary drivers of recent climate change. These activities increase concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), in the atmosphere.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Global Temperature Rise**: The Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century, with most of the warming occurring in recent decades. This warming is largely attributed to increased emissions of greenhouse gases.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Extreme Weather Events**: Climate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy precipitation. These events can have devastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels**: Arctic sea ice and glaciers worldwide are melting, contributing to rising sea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 8 inches (20 centimeters) since 1880, posing risks to coastal communities through increased flooding and erosion.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased CO2 levels are leading to ocean acidification, which affects marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, like corals and some shellfish.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Impact on Biodiversity**: Climate change alters habitats and threatens species with extinction. Shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns affect migration, reproduction, and survival rates of various species.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Socio-Economic Impacts**: Climate change has significant implications for agriculture, water resources, health, and global economies. Food security may be threatened by changing growing conditions, while health risks can increase due to heat stress and the spread of diseases.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Mitigation and Adaptation**: Efforts to combat climate change include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and enhancing energy efficiency. Adaptation strategies are also crucial, involving changes to infrastructure, land use, and community planning to reduce vulnerability to climate impacts.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **International Agreements**: Global efforts, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These agreements require countries to set and achieve emissions reduction targets.\n",
